# Perp, An Easy To Use Purple Team Competition Framework

## Some features
 - Easy to use (set up time sub 10 minutes as seen in [this](./FinalVideo.mp4) video
 - Supports 255 users via OpenVPN off of competitor's own machines
 - Automated flag submission page and scoreboard
 - Regenerating flags on 10 minute intervals (in /tmp/flag.txt and /root/flag.txt)
 - 4 machines per team (though easily scalable)
 - Run entirely off of a docker-compose file meaning the whole network can be run on 1 machine
